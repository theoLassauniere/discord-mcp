# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Member lookup (`get_member`, `assign_role`, `kick_member`, etc.) now finds bots and members who joined after the server started — bots are kept in the member cache, raw user IDs are fetched directly from Discord, and the cache is refreshed once before reporting a member as not found (#3)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- `update` CLI command — checks npm for the latest version, clears the npx cache, and shows next steps. No reconfiguration needed.
- Updating section in README with instructions for keeping the package up to date

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- 5 new thread tools (10 → 15 total, 134 → 139 overall):
  - `get_thread` — get detailed thread info (type, slowmode, auto-archive, owner, URL)
  - `get_thread_messages` — read messages from a thread with before/after pagination
  - `list_archived_threads` — list public or private archived threads in a channel
  - `edit_thread` — edit thread name, auto-archive duration, slowmode, locked/archived status
  - `get_thread_pinned_messages` — get all pinned messages in a thread
- Thread-aware fuzzy matching in `smartFindTextChannel` — all 14 message tools (send, edit, pin, react, etc.) now work in threads automatically
- Archived thread support — direct ID fetch fallback in both `findThread` and `smartFindTextChannel` so archived threads are accessible by ID

### Improved

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Typewriter animation effect on the welcome message for a polished first impression
- Token format pre-validation — detects malformed tokens before attempting Discord login
- Retry loop on invalid token — users can paste a new token without restarting the wizard
- Quick permission pre-check built into `init` — shows pass/fail summary right after guild selection
- Configuration summary card at the end of setup showing bot, server, and clients configured
- Staged spinner messages during connection (`Resolving gateway...` → `Authenticating...` → `Fetching servers...`)
- Richer guild selection display with boost level indicators
- Smooth animated transitions between wizard steps

### Improved

- Spinner now supports `.update()` to change its message mid-animation
- Completion banner uses typewriter animation for a satisfying finish

- Next steps box has cleaner column alignment for all client names
- Authentication failure now offers to retry instead of exiting immediately

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Troubleshooting section in README covering all common errors with fixes
- Actionable startup error messages that point to `init` or `check` commands
- More npm keywords for discoverability (cursor, windsurf, claude-desktop, ai-tools)
- GitHub repo topics for better search visibility

### Improved

- Startup log messages use `[discord-mcp]` prefix for cleaner output
- Error on missing token/guild now shows the exact command to fix it
- Failed startup points to `npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp check` for diagnostics

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- MCP server version was hardcoded to `1.0.0` — now reads dynamically from `package.json`
- CLI logo showed hardcoded `v1.0` — removed (version shown via `--version` flag instead)
- Dead code: Windsurf path ternary had identical branches
- Missing `Manage Auto Moderation` permission in bot setup guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` was excluded from npm package — now included
- Duplicate startup log messages consolidated

### Improved

- `docs/discord-mcp-server.md` — rewritten setup section with CLI-first workflow, multi-client config table
- `docs/bot-setup-guide.md` — Step 6 now leads with `npx init` wizard, manual setup as fallback
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — added project structure diagram, CLI development section, and CHANGELOG to docs checklist
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — added CLI testing and CHANGELOG checklist items
- `.env.example` — documented `BOT_TOKEN` fallback
- `package.json` — added `exports` map for ESM consumers, updated description to mention all supported clients
- README architecture diagram updated with accurate file descriptions

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Init wizard now detects non-project directories (Desktop, Downloads, home, Documents, etc.) and writes Claude Code config to global `~/.claude.json` instead of a useless project-scoped `.mcp.json`
- Shows a warning when running from a suspicious directory with clear explanation of what will happen

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- `@everyone` role now resolves correctly — was previously excluded from the role cache, causing "not found" errors when targeting it in permission tools
- Role cache now includes `@everyone` alongside all other roles

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Discord gateway rate limit errors (opcode 8) during startup member fetch — now retries with exponential backoff
- All 99 tool calls now automatically retry on rate limits (up to 3 attempts with backoff)
- Rate limit `retry_after` value is parsed from Discord's error response for optimal wait times

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Multi-client support in `init` wizard — auto-detects and configures:
  - Claude Code (`.mcp.json`)
  - Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)
  - Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
  - Windsurf (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`)
- "All detected" option to configure every installed client at once
- "Skip" option with manual config output and file path reference
- Client-specific next steps shown after setup

### Changed

- `mcp-server.ts` now exports `main()` for CLI imports
